INTRODUCTION:
#############

This following set of tools written in C allows for the hiding of
a message with images.

Currently supported images are:
Plain Binary PPM
24 bit BMPs

COMPILING:
############

GCC is used to compile and compilation should be supported up until C99
The program can be complied in the following ways:

make clean			  	- cleans any previous compliation and removes any output files

make all  				- makes both hide and unhide
make hide 				- makes hide only
make unhide 			- makes unhide only

make alldebug 			- makes both hide and unhide with debug output
make hidedebug  		- makes hide with debug output
make unhidedebug 		- makes unhide with debug output

HIDING:
###########
To hide a message within a image:
./hide imagename outputfilename

Example:
./hide example.ppm output.ppm

The end of the message is marked up a EOF character. This can be enter into the terminal by presseing ctrl+D
sometimes it takes a couple of ctrl+ds to work. Dunno why

UNHIDING:
###########
To unhide a message from an image:
./unhide filename

Example:
./unhide output.ppm

If the image does not contain a message then the output message may be garbled or not exist at all.

The output of the message will be start and end with a line of '########################'


SUPPORTED FUNCTIONALITY:
########################
Both hiding and unhiding a message within both a 24Bit (255 depth) standard PPM image and 24 Bit BMP images.
A BMP with an alpha channel or compression is not supported.

Any non malformed header for both image types is supported. This includes any number of
comments within the PPM format.

Implementation is file extension agnostic. Image types are dependent on the magic number of the file header.

Error detection is supported and should detect any incomplete image pixel map, incorrect headers, malformed headers and
message lengths which are too long.

Piping is supported. Example
printf "Test" | ./hide input.ppm output.ppm

TEST SUITE:
########################
A test suite of images is provided. This runs a series of tests through both unhide and hide.
Results are stored in log.txt and included leak detection form valgrind

Unfortunately results need to be via manual inspection.
This can be done with
less log.txt
