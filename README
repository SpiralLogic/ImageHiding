INTRODUCTION:
#############

This following set of tools written in C allows for the hiding of
a message with images.

Currently supported images are:
Plain Binary PPM
24 bit BMPs

COMPILING:
############

GCC is used to compile and compilation should be support up until C99
The program can be complied in the following ways:

make clean			  	- cleans any previous compliation and removes any output files

make all  				- makes both hide and unhide
make hide 				- makes hide only
make unhide 			- makes unhide only

make alldebug 			- makes both hide and unhide with debug output
make hidedebug  		- makes hide with debug output
make unhidedebug 		- makes unhide with debug output

HIDING:
###########
To hide a message within a image:
./hide imagename outputfilename


i.e. ./hide example.ppm output.ppm

The message must be enclosed in inverted commas. To include an inverted comma in the message a \ must be placed before the inverted comma.


UNHIDING:
###########
To unhide a message from an image:
./unhide filename

i.e. ./unhide output.ppm

If the message does not contain a message then the output message may be garbled or not exist at all.


SUPPORTED FUNCTIONALITY:
########################
Both hiding and unhiding a message within both a 24Bit (255 depth) Plain PPM image and 24 Bit BMP image. A BMP with an alpha channel or compression is not supported.

Any non malformed header for both image types is supported. This includes any number of
comments within the PPM format.

Implementation is file extension agnostic. Image types are dependent on the magic number of the file header.

Error detection is supported and should detect any incomplete image pixel map, incorrect headers, malformed headers and message lengths which are too long.
